# LC-DOM-Lights-Out

To get my OWN practice with the DOM - I created a simple version of a classic logic game, Lights Out! Bonus features: random color assignments and animated glow mode.

Students - if you're ready to dive into the somewhat-less-shallow end, FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine.

This was inspired by the practice exercises and examples I've been making for students of LaunchCode's Web Development course (unit 1).
